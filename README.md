![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/keepassxreboot/keepassx.svg?branch=master "Travis-CI Badge")

## About

Fork of [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) with keepasshttp support for use with [PassIFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/passifox/) for Mozilla Firefox and [chromeIPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae) for Google Chrome.

KeePassHttp implementation has been forked from jdachtera's repository, which in turn was based on code from code with Francois Ferrand's [keepassx-http](https://gitorious.org/keepassx/keepassx-http/source/master:) repository. 

This is a rebuild from [denk-mal's keepasshttp](https://github.com/denk-mal/keepassx.git) that brings it forward to Qt5 and KeePassX v2.0.2.

#### Build Dependencies
